## Summary
Skill Me is a web app that uses Named Entity Recognizion in NLP to identify predifined key job skills from text of course titles or descriptions.

[SkillMe Development](https://github.com/mollyteng/insight/tree/master/skill_me) contains the development steps of SkillMe.

[SkillMe Application](https://github.com/mollyteng/insight/tree/master/webapp) contains the source code for the web app.

## Context and Use Case
Survey shows that 40% of employers can not find the talents with the right skills they need, while for individuals, it is hard to find personalized career and learning pathways to achieve their goals. It would be great if we can build an AI-powered platform that matches people, business and learning resources. As a first step, I developped SKill Me, an NLP-based model that automates the process of extracting job skills from various sources of texts.

This is a consulting project I worked on with FutureFit AI as an Insight Data Science Fellow.
