How we live our lives today is a direct result of features developed from our primate ancestors as they adapted to new environments.  </p>\\n<p>In primatology, it is essential to think about how cultural development and biological natures are inseparable.  </p>\\n<p>This course will help you rediscover the process of evolution and will introduce primatological studies conducted by researchers at Kyoto University, Japan. Based on carefully conducted research on primate species, we will explore the origins of human beings and provide you with examples of common similarities between human beings and non-human primates.  </p>\\n<p>We will analyze basic features, such as foraging, mating, aggression, and communication from the primatological viewpoint. Furthermore, cultural and social aspects of human society, from the formation of family groups to community activities, will be considered thoroughly, in comparison to those of monkeys and apes.  </p>\\n<p>Our goal is to broaden your view of humans to a wider extent and think dynamically about your biology in terms of human evolution. Through acquiring knowledge of basic primatology in this course, you will establish a viewpoint to think and discuss the evolutionary process of human, and human society, in conjunction with those of our close relatives.</p>',\n",

       " 'description': 'Six Sigma is a data-driven improvement strategy that views all activities within an organization as processes. Process inputs can be controlled and adjusted to effect significant improvements in process outputs. Six Sigma uses a rigorous and systematic methodology known as DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and a number of qualitative and quantitative tools. Its goal is to drive process, product, and service improvements for reducing variation and defects. Lean is also an improvement methodology, but with a different focus. It aims to enhance process flow, reduce cycle time, and eliminate waste.   Though Lean and Six Sigma originated in different places and under different circumstances, they are now largely seen as complementary methodologies. Organizations across various industries are striving to become faster and more responsive to customers, achieve near-perfect quality, and operate using world-class cost structures. You need both Lean and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. This course introduces Six Sigma and Lean methodologies and looks at the relationship between them. It also explores relationships among business systems and processes using some practical examples of Lean Six Sigma applications in both manufacturing and service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft’s ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.',\n",
