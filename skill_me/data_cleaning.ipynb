Instructor guides and student materials are provided as part of the program, focusing on experiential learning techniques with a comprehensive online assessment at the end of the course. Students will be required to pass the assessment to receive the certificate.\\nSince CEWD is a coalition made up of energy companies, this credential is being created by the industry for the industry. This ensures that students are learning the right material that will help them succeed at their jobs.\\nEnergy Industry Fundamentals is divided into modules. For those who want to offer the opportunity for their students to earn the credentials, all modules must be completed. This may not be the case in all situations, so schools or other training organizations can just use specific modules to fill in what they are already doing.',\n",

Can you find a shape that has finite volume, but infinite surface area? How does the weight of the rider change the trajectory of a zip line ride? These and many other questions can be answered by harnessing the power of the integral.</p>\\r\\n<p>But what is an integral? You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative. You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics. You will use integrals to find centers of mass, the stress on a beam during construction, the power exerted by a motor, and the distance traveled by a rocket.</p>\\r\\n<p>This course, in combination with Part 1, covers the AP* Calculus AB curriculum.</p>\\r\\n<p>This course, in combination with Parts 1 and 3, covers the AP* Calculus BC curriculum.</p>\\r\\n<p>This course was funded in part by the Wertheimer Fund.</p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.edx.org/high-school-initiative\">Learn more about our High School and AP* Exam Preparation Courses</a></p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation-mitx-18-01-1x?utm_campaign=mitx&amp;utm_medium=partner-marketing&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_content=18-01-2x-to-18-01-1x\">Calculus 1A: Differentiation</a></p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1c-coordinate-systems-infinite-mitx-18-01-3x?utm_campaign=mitx&amp;utm_medium=partner-marketing&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_content=18-01-2x-to-18-01-3x\">Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems &amp; Infinite Series</a></p>\\r\\n<p><em>*Advanced Placement and AP are registered trademarks of the College Board, which was not involved in the production of, and does not endorse, these offerings.</em></p>',\n",

Participants will be taken through photography, from the basics of choosing correct equipment and setting it up, to optimum settings, techniques for consistent imaging and the safe storage of images.The course is taught by the team that delivers the online masters degree course in Advanced General Dental Practice from the School of Dentistry at the University of Birmingham UK, and will involve about five hours per week of your time.Quotes from previous learners:“That was fantastic. I feel I have a great grasp on the settings on my camera and flash and what they all mean, and feel quite confident to take photographs of patients that I can use for practice promotion and records. Thanks so much!” - Andrea Lakatos“I really enjoyed this course and I finally understand the settings in my camera. Thanks Mike for making every lesson so easy and keeping me motivated!!” - Vania Wassel Antich“Fantastic course! Can’t wait to share what I’ve learnt with the rest of the girls at work. Thank you so much!” - Hollie WilliamsNo previous knowledge is necessary, but there will be certain requirements in terms of equipment necessary to complete the course - particularly access to a digital SLR camera. Detailed advice on choosing a camera will be given at the start of the course, but if you’re keen to get a head start, then you can download Equipment Recommendations (PDF, 232k).The course is designed to be of interest and applicable to all members of the dental team.Time spent by UK dental professionals on this course will count as non-verifiable CPD.',\n",

       " 'description': \"Forming an effective Six Sigma team for driving improvement projects throughout an organization is essential to Six Sigma success. Teams are vital to Six Sigma and Lean projects that have goals of improving an organization's existing quality, enhancing bottom-line performance, and reducing costs. The methods used to form and develop a Six Sigma team will have a dramatic effect on the team's overall performance. Black Belts need to proactively contribute to the effectiveness of Six Sigma teams to promote positive organizational change.  This course explores the variety of team types, roles, and composition, revealing strategies for selecting strong Six Sigma teams whose members bring diverse talents, knowledge, and aptitudes to the team. The course also examines factors critical to team success including management support, clarity of goals, and following ground rules. Acknowledging that today's organizations increasingly rely on virtual teams that cross geographic and cultural barriers, the course equips you with strategies for meeting the unique challenges of virtual teams. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.\",\n",
