ec,93,Supply Chain Dynamics,"Supply Chains are complex systems involving multiple firms and organizations with different goals and objectives. Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain&rsquo;s efficiency and effectiveness. Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional.</p>
This course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x. It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry. We will divide the course into three sections.</p>
First, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance.</p>
Second, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions &ndash; from both within and outside of the supply chain. Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside.</p>
Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.<br /><br />This course is part of a MicroMasters program.</strong></p>",Supply Chain Knowledge
ec,94,Supply Chain Technology and Systems,"There are underlying fundamental principles and concepts that apply to all supply chains, which can be expressed in relatively straightforward models. However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.</p>
Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today&rsquo;s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.</p>
We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.</p>
We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.</p>

ec,348,An Introduction to Credit Risk Management,"Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</p>
According to the Basel Accords, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today&rsquo;s world.</p>
This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.</p>
At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.</p>

Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries for performing all kinds of analyses. Together, these two features make it possible for a data scientist to very quickly go from raw data to summaries, charts, and even full-blown reports. However, one deficiency with R is that traditionally it uses a lot of memory, both because it needs to load a copy of the data in its entirety as a data.frame object, and also because processing the data often involves making further copies (sometimes referred to as copy-on-modify). This is one of the reasons R has been more reluctantly received by industry compared to academia.</p>
The main component of Microsoft R Server (MRS) is the RevoScaleR package, which is an R library that offers a set of functionalities for processing large datasets without having to load them all at once in the memory. RevoScaleR offers a rich set of distributed statistical and machine learning algorithms, which get added to over time. Finally, RevoScaleR also offers a mechanism by which we can take code that we developed on our laptop and deploy it on a remote server such as SQL Server or Spark (where the infrastructure is very different under the hood), with minimal effort.</p>
In this course, we will show you how to use MRS to run an analysis on a large dataset and provide some examples of how to deploy it on a Spark cluster or a SQL Server database. Upon completion, you will know how to use R for big-data problems.</p>
Since RevoScaleR is an R package, we assume that the course participants are familiar with R. A solid understanding of R data structures (vectors, matrices, lists, data frames, environments) is required.&nbsp;Familiarity with 3rd party packages such as dplyr is also helpful.<br /><br />edX offers financial assistance for learners who want to earn Verified Certificates but who may not be able to pay the fee.

ec,548,Analytics for Decision Making,"Want to know how to avoid bad decisions with data?</p>
Making good decisions with data can give you a distinct competitive advantage in business. This statistics and data analysis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of sound statistical thinking that can be applied in surprisingly wide contexts, sometimes even before there is any data! Key concepts like understanding variation, perceiving relative risk of alternative decisions, and pinpointing sources of variation will be highlighted.</p>
These big picture ideas have motivated the development of quantitative models, but in most traditional statistics courses, these concepts get lost behind a wall of little techniques and computations. In this course we keep the focus on the ideas that really matter, and we illustrate them with lively, practical, accessible examples.</p>
We will explore questions like: How are traditional statistical methods still relevant in modern analytics applications? How can we avoid common fallacies and misconceptions when approaching quantitative problems? How do we apply statistical methods in predictive applications? How do we gain a better understanding of customer engagement through analytics?</p>
This course will be is relevant for anyone eager to have a framework for good decision-making. It will be good preparation for students with a bachelor’s degree contemplating graduate study in a business field.</p>
Opportunities in analytics are abundant at the moment. Specific techniques or software packages may be helpful in landing first jobs, but those techniques and packages may soon be replaced by something newer and trendier. Understanding the ways in which quantitative models really work, however, is a management level skill that is unlikely to go out of style.</p>

It's more likely for the data to be in a file, a database, or extracted from documents such as web pages, tweets, or PDFs. In these cases, the first step is to import the data into R and tidy the data, using the tidyverse package. The steps that convert data from its raw form to the tidy form is called data wrangling.<br /><br />This process is a critical step for any data scientist. Knowing how to wrangle and clean data will enable you to make critical insights that would otherwise be hidden.",Data Science

ec,1155,FinTech Ethics and Risks,"FinTech has started a global revolution in the financial services industry, and the transformation will only increase in coming years. There are many ways in which FinTech can improve the lives of people around the world; however, those same technologies can also be used to enslave, coerce, track, and control people. Accordingly, it is appropriate and necessary to consider the implications of the introduction of these technologies so that they are utilized properly, regulated sufficiently, and their adoption does not come at the expense of societal growth. <br /><br />This 6-week online course&nbsp;covers&nbsp; 6 modules, representing the full spectrum of finance, technology, and the introduction of FinTech solutions globally. We will ask questions that are not often asked or addressed when new technologies are adopted. Why should we adopt FinTech solutions, and what are the best ways to introduce disruptive technologies? How does blockchain technology change the way we provide financial services, and how should blockchain technology be governed? Is FinTech creating risks in cybersecurity and how can technology help us prevent financial crimes? As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developed and adopted, will human biases and prejudices be built into such mechanisms? And at a larger scope, should FinTech lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance, or will existing institutions adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets?<br /><br />Through discussing and attempting to answer these questions, you will understand better how the introduction of these technologies can benefit or harm society. And through considering the proper application or introduction of such technologies, you will learn to make better decisions as an individual and organization when facing the question: is FinTech our savior or a villain?",Fintech
ec,1156,"Blockchain and FinTech: Basics, Applications, and Limitations","Blockchain is a core technology in FinTech. The original design of blockchain focused on the cryptocurrency &ldquo;Bitcoin&rdquo;. Due to its specific characteristics, many companies and users now find blockchain very useful for applications in many areas, not limited to cybercurrencies, including finance, logistics, insurance, medicine and even music. However, the design of blockchain involves cryptographic technology, which cannot be easily understood by those who are not professionals in the area of IT and security. <br /><br />In order to better understand what kinds of applications best fit blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology and the potentials of these emerging technologies, it is important to understand the design rationale, the basic technology, the underlying cryptographic fundamentals, and its limitations. This 6-week online course&nbsp;will walk you through the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>The design rationale behind blockchain and the issues for such decentralized ledger (transaction) systems.</li>
<li>The underlying technology (e.g. how the fundamental algorithms &ndash; the cryptographic primitives &ndash; work together) behind and how it makes blockchain works and safe.</li>
<li>The differences of the various existing blockchain platforms and what these platforms can provide (e.g. pros and cons of the major platforms).</li>
<li>What kinds of applications (both traditional and emerging) best fit the blockchain technology and how blockchain technology can benefit these applications.</li>
<li>Blockchain does have its limitations. We will uncover the problems and the limitations of blockchain technology to enable developers and researchers to think about how to enhance the existing blockchain technology and practitioners to better address the issues when using blockchains in their applications.</li>
<li>This course will also briefly discuss the downside of blockchain with respect to the protection of criminal activities (e.g. why ransomware always ask for bitcoins as ransom, and the money laundering problem).</li>

The course aims at targeting a wide audience: This course will provide learners a good understanding of the technological, applicability, limitations and &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; usage of the blockchain technology.",Blockchain
ec,1164,Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications,"Blockchain technology is changing how business is executed. It&rsquo;s important to understand why blockchain is different and how it works in comparison with technologies of the past.<br /><br />The first segment of this course covers all the main concepts of what Blockchain is. It discusses how it began as a triple ledger system first introduced for the administration of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and how it is now applied to all aspects of business including government, banking, supply chains, and a host of other industries.<br /><br />It also analyzes the concept of transparent ledgers, both public and permissioned, and focuses on using cryptography to achieve consensus, immutability, and governance of transactions. This is all part of Blockchain&rsquo;s ability to provide &ldquo;trusted data from untrusted sources,&rdquo; disrupting traditional accounting methodologies and international trade.<br /><br />The course then dives into the various methods of blockchain governance that currently exist in the marketplace as well as how consensus fits into governance. It explores how to reach consensus through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. <br /><br />Other aspects of the course include examining the very specific features of blockchain that solve problems that have been difficult to overcome in the past with more centralized architectures.<br /><br />The final part of the course takes a deep dive into the various use cases of blockchain, complete with analyzing real examples of how different industries are executing the technology and improving their business. Examining a problem, and then depicting a blockchain use case that solves the problem, will help gain an understanding of how blockchain is applied to real-world situations.",Blockchain

fl,762,Business Analytics Using Forecasting,"Companies, governments and other organizations now collect and analyze huge amounts of data about suppliers, clients, employees, citizens, transactions, and much more. There are a number of ways organizations can use this data. Business analytics uses this data to make better decisions and forecasting is an arm of this predictive analytics. Forecasting especially can provide a powerful toolkit for analyzing time series data.Learn about forecasting in a wider contextQuantitative forecasting uses statistical and data mining methods to generating numerical forecasts, an important component of decision making across many business functions, including economic forecasting, workload projections, sales forecasts, and power and transportation demand. Today’s big data forecasting can include forecasting many series on a frequent basis, such as daily demand of thousands of products at retail chains, hourly statistics of wind turbines, minute-by-minute web traffic, and call volume to call centers.Forecasting can also be combined with statistical monitoring methods for purposes of anomaly detection – for example, public health organizations collect and monitor clinical and other data for detecting disease outbreaks. Forecasting is also often combined with simulation for purposes of scenario building. On this course we’ll have a look at some of these uses in more depth as well as examining the processes that these different industries use.Understand the forecasting processThis course focuses on forecasting time series, where past and present values are used to forecast future values of a series of interest.

ss,0,Fundamentals of Lean and Six Sigma and their Applications,"Six Sigma is a data-driven improvement strategy that views all activities within an organization as processes. Process inputs can be controlled and adjusted to effect significant improvements in process outputs. Six Sigma uses a rigorous and systematic methodology known as DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and a number of qualitative and quantitative tools. Its goal is to drive process, product, and service improvements for reducing variation and defects. Lean is also an improvement methodology, but with a different focus. It aims to enhance process flow, reduce cycle time, and eliminate waste.   Though Lean and Six Sigma originated in different places and under different circumstances, they are now largely seen as complementary methodologies. Organizations across various industries are striving to become faster and more responsive to customers, achieve near-perfect quality, and operate using world-class cost structures. You need both Lean and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. This course introduces Six Sigma and Lean methodologies and looks at the relationship between them. It also explores relationships among business systems and processes using some practical examples of Lean Six Sigma applications in both manufacturing and service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft’s ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.",Six Sigma
ss,1,"Six Sigma Project Selection, Roles, and Responsibilities","Deployment of Six Sigma, Lean, or another continuous improvement methodology demands major investments of time, effort, and money on behalf of an organization. Organizations need to exercise due diligence to determine if Six Sigma or Lean is the appropriate methodology to employ, or perhaps a less demanding quality and process improvement approach is better suited to meet their needs. Having decided on the methodology, improvement teams need to determine screening criteria for the selection of most appropriate improvement projects. Success of these projects largely depends upon the contribution of a variety of Six Sigma stakeholders. As a key Six Sigma stakeholder, Black Belts often lead improvement teams and their skills and qualifications are critical to teams' ability to deliver the expected results.  This course deals with the key considerations around the selection of Six Sigma, Lean, and continuous improvement projects. It also explores roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders and qualifications needed for Black Belts for leading Six Sigma teams. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.",Six Sigma
ss,2,Six Sigma Strategic Planning and Deployment,"Strategic planning of Six Sigma projects and Lean initiatives plays a critical role in their success in an organization deploying them. A number of strategic analysis and planning tools, such as Hoshin Kanri, feasibility studies, SWOT and PEST analysis, can be used in support of strategic deployment of improvement projects and to enhance their value and effectiveness.   An organization's culture and its inherent structure, lack of resources, and top leadership support sometimes create organizational roadblocks that may result in deployment failures. Six Sigma Black Belts should be able to identify these roadblocks and deal with them effectively. Six Sigma deployment is a revolutionary strategy and may result in significant organizational changes. Black Belts need to proactively anticipate human responses, overcome them, and lead the organizational change.

ss,4,Using Business and Financial Measures in Six Sigma,"Six Sigma improvement begins with assessing the current performance of an organization's processes and products, and comparing it with the desired performance. An important part of this assessment is choosing a set of measures that will provide a comprehensive picture of how the company is achieving its goals of customer satisfaction, organizational learning and improvement, internal process performance, and bottom-line financial growth. This course examines two categories of key measures: business performance measures and purely financial measures, exploring how these measures reveal the current state of the business and point to gains achievable through Six Sigma.  This course explores how business performance measures such as balanced scorecard, key performance indicators (KPIs), and lagging and leading indicators can be used to align Lean Six Sigma initiatives toward organizational goals. It also explores the critical role of customer loyalty in business success. Turning to purely financial measures of success, this course explores how these financial measures are crucial in determining whether the potential returns of Six Sigma projects will outweigh the required investment. It provides practice in using the formulas associated with these measures, including market share, cost-benefit analysis, return on investment (ROI), net present value (NPV), and hard and soft costs and benefits of Six Sigma projects. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.",Six Sigma
ss,5,"Six Sigma Team Dynamics, Roles, and Success Factors","Forming an effective Six Sigma team for driving improvement projects throughout an organization is essential to Six Sigma success. Teams are vital to Six Sigma and Lean projects that have goals of improving an organization's existing quality, enhancing bottom-line performance, and reducing costs. The methods used to form and develop a Six Sigma team will have a dramatic effect on the team's overall performance. Black Belts need to proactively contribute to the effectiveness of Six Sigma teams to promote positive organizational change.

ss,8,Determining Requirements by Listening to the Voice of the Customer in Six Sigma,"Customers are at the heart of all Six Sigma initiatives, and this focus on customers is what makes Six Sigma an outstanding organizational performance improvement program. The voice of the customer (VOC) is a Six Sigma strategy used to capture requirements and feedback from customers in order to meet their requirements. Voice of the customer is a critical input at every stage in the Six Sigma DMAIC process, particularly at the Define stage. At this stage, critical customer requirements concerning quality, cost, process, and delivery are collected and translated into measurable, actionable project goals using a number of tools. Using VOC begins with defining Six Sigma goals for collecting and analyzing customer requirements. It is imperative that Six Sigma leaders determine the critical to x (CTx) requirements concerning quality, cost, process, and delivery requirements of customers and the organization. Then the team needs to identify and select the most effective methods for collecting customer feedback and requirements. From there, customer requirements are translated into measurable, actionable project goals.  This course examines how an organization uses the voice of the customer to define the problem at hand and to set the direction of its Six Sigma efforts. It discusses some common customer data collection methods – such as surveys, interviews, and focus groups – and looks at how to ensure validity and reliability in data collection. In addition, the course illustrates how tools such as CTx, SIPOC, Kano analysis, critical-to-quality (CTQ) analysis, and quality function deployment (QFD) are used to translate customer data into critical customer requirements and actionable goals for the Six Sigma team. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.",Six Sigma
ss,9,"Six Sigma Business Case, Project Charter, and Tools","A project charter is the most important document used to initiate and manage a Six Sigma project. It is treated as an informal contract between an organization and the Six Sigma team. The project charter articulates the business case for Six Sigma projects, specific problem that the Six Sigma team is going to work on, and the project's scope, goals, and objectives in very clear, specific, and measurable terms. As part of the process of developing a project charter, some performance measures such as cost, revenue, and schedule are identified and developed. Once the project is kicked off, the project charter is reviewed periodically by stakeholders in relation to a project's actual progress.

ss,10,Process Flow Metrics and Analysis Tools for Six Sigma,"To improve the processes behind an organization's products and services, a Six Sigma Black Belt must measure them. Among the many Six Sigma tools, several are designed specifically to identify and prioritize process input and output variables and their importance relative to customer or business requirements. Using cause-and-effect matrices, Black Belts can determine which process inputs to target first. Using process efficiency formulas, they can determine the ratio of value-added time to total lead time, then enhance this ratio by reducing that troublesome drag on lead time – work in process. With metrics established, Black Belts can recommend approaches to balance the flow of processes and determine the impact that 'hidden factories' could have on process flow metrics. Looking closer at the steps of a given process, Black Belts are then able to wield a number of analysis tools such as flowcharts, spaghetti diagrams, process maps, value stream maps, and gemba walk to reveal lurking time traps, constraints, and wasted steps – all with a view of improving process characteristics for optimum efficiency.  This course provides strategies to measure the current state of an organization's processes by analyzing the variables of its processes, using metrics to calculate process flow performance, and employing tools to analyze processes. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

ss,13,Using Basic Statistics and Graphical Methods in Six Sigma,"Organizations must ensure that their products and services are extremely consistent to desired specifications, as variations can lead to rejected orders, reworks, and eventually, customer dissatisfaction and financial losses. Statistics can provide Black Belts with the tools to summarize and assess collected data in a meaningful way for identifying sources of variation and controlling them. Black Belts can use descriptive (enumerative) statistics to tabulate and graphically represent sample data through a number of informative charts and diagrams. Using analytical (inferential) statistics, supported by the central limit theorem, Black Belts can confidently make inferences, test the statistical validity of their inferences, and optimize and control processes.  This course provides Black Belts with basic statistical tools for describing, presenting, and analyzing data. It explores the process of preparing and presenting sample data using graphical methods and then making valid inferences about the population represented by the sample. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation.

ss,14,Probability and Probability Distributions in Six Sigma,"Organizations need to make inferences about a population from sample data, and understanding how to calculate the probability that an event will occur is crucial to making those inferences. In a Six Sigma context, it is often important to calculate the likelihood that a combination of events or that an ordered combination of events will occur. Understanding probabilities can provide Black Belts with the tools to make predictions about events or event combinations. To make accurate inferences about a population from the sample data collected in the Measure stage, Black Belts must also be familiar with the characteristics of various probability distributions, and their suitability for different types of data. Understanding the behavior of probability distributions allows the Black Belts to find the probability that values will be found within a given range, and thus to provide information on the variation in the organization's processes and products.   This course provides Black Belts with basic information on probabilities and probability distributions, from the frequently used normal, Poisson, and binomial distributions, to the more specialized hypergeometric, Weibull, bivariate, exponential, and lognormal, as well as the distributions that test hypothesis and set confidence intervals: Chi-square, Student's t, and F distributions. When chosen appropriately to represent the data, these distributions will provide information on process and product variation, and support subsequent inferences based on sample data.

It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft's ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.",Six Sigma
ss,15,Determining Process Performance and Capability in Six Sigma,"In any improvement initiative, organizations must determine whether their existing processes meet the targets and specifications demanded by the customer, or by the business. Measuring and analyzing the capability and performance of a process under review enables organizations to numerically represent and interpret its current state, and to report its sigma level. When done correctly, process capability analyses enable Black Belts to precisely assess current performance in light of future goals, and ultimately, to determine the need and targets of process improvement. Process capabilities can be determined for normal and non-normal data, variable (continuous) and attribute (discrete) data, and for long- and short-term alike.  This course explores key considerations and calculations used in determining process capability and performance. This includes choosing parameters, verifying the stability and normality of a given process, and gathering and interpreting capability and performance data using common indices. The course also explores the special treatment of non-normal data and attributes data in the context of a capability study and long-and short-term capability.

ss,16,Measuring and Modeling Relationships between Variables in Six Sigma,"As a Six Sigma team moves into the Analyze stage of the DMAIC process, it looks more closely at the variables and variable interrelationships identified during the Measure stage. As part of the analysis, a scatter diagram of dependent and independent variables is drawn to visualize the form, strength, and direction of their relationships. By determining their correlation coefficient, a linear relationship can be quantified and identified as positive, negative, or neutral. Then, using regression analysis, a model is developed to describe the relationship as a linear equation and then used for predictions and estimations. However, it is essential to analyze the uncertainty in the estimate, to test that the relationship between variables is statistically significant, and that the model is valid.  This course discusses two important tools – correlation and regression analysis for measuring and modeling relationships between variables. In terms of correlation, it takes learners through examples of scatter diagrams for two variables, the calculation and interpretation of the correlation coefficient, and the interpretation of its confidence interval. The course also draws learners' attention to some key considerations in correlation analysis, such as correlation and causation. In terms of regression analysis, the course discusses the simple linear regression model, how to create it using sample data, interpret and use it, and conduct a hypothesis test to check that the relationship between the variables is statistically significant. Finally, the course looks into how residual analysis is used to test the validity of the regression model.

ss,17,Basics of Hypothesis Testing and Tests for Means in Six Sigma,"In the Analyze phase of the DMAIC methodology, Six Sigma teams analyze the underlying causes of issues that need to be addressed for the successful completion of their improvement projects. To that end, teams conduct a number of statistical analyses to determine the nature of variables and their interrelationships in the process under study. It is rarely possible to study and analyze the full scope of population data pertaining to all processes, products, or services, so Six Sigma teams typically collect samples of the population data to be analyzed, and based on that sample data, they make hypotheses about the entire population. Because there is a lot at stake in forming the correct conclusions about the larger population, Six Sigma teams validate their inferences using hypothesis tests.  This course builds on basic hypothesis testing concepts, terminologies, and some of the most commonly used hypothesis tests – one- and two-sample tests for means. The course also discusses the importance of sample size and power in hypothesis testing, as well as exploring issues relating to point estimators and confidence intervals in hypothesis testing.

ss,19,Multivariate Tools and Nonparametric Tests in Six Sigma,"In the Analyze phase of the DMAIC methodology, a Six Sigma team begins to analyze the root causes of the problems that it identified in the earlier stages. This analysis may require churning out huge volumes of data of different types. Sometimes this data is of a multivariate nature, meaning that many dependent and independent variables need to be considered simultaneously. As such, Six Sigma teams often use advanced multivariate tools to manage this type of data. Another set of advanced statistical analysis tools used in this phase is nonparametric tests. In conventional hypothesis tests – called parametric tests – a sample statistic is obtained to estimate a population parameter and hence requires a number of assumptions to be made about the underlying population, such as the normality of data. However, a nonparametric test is used when some of these assumptions, such as normality of data, cannot be safely made.  This course deals with multivariate and categorical data analysis tools such as factor analysis, discriminant analysis, and multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA). The course also aims to familiarize learners with approaches for analyzing nonparametric data, particularly the use of Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests for validating hypotheses.
